## Overview

Lite Anvil is a fork of [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl), rewritten from the ground up in Rust.

Lite Anvil also ships **Nano Anvil**, a minimal single-file editor that uses software rendering (no GPU drivers), and **Note Anvil**, a markdown note-taking app with live preview. See the [Installation](installation.md) page for details on all three binaries.
