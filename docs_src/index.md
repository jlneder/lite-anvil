## Overview

Lite-Anvil is a fork of [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl), rewritten from the ground up in Rust.

Lite-Anvil also ships **Nano-Anvil**, a minimal single-file editor that uses software rendering (no GPU drivers), starts at ~28MB RAM, and omits the sidebar, terminal, LSP, git integration, and other heavy features. See the [Installation](installation/) page for details on both binaries.
